All the files are provided as .cti files, which can be directly read by Cantera, 
a chemical kinetic software. http://www.cantera.org/docs/sphinx/html/index.html

Each .cti files contains:
(1) a list of species
(2) NASA polynomial of all the species
(3) temperature dependent reaction coefficients

CNOH_reaction_network.cti : modified based on the Venot et al. (2012) network. 
P_Reaction_Set.cti : modified P/H/O reaction network based on the Twaroski (1995) network.
my_silane_v2.cti : modifed Si/H/O reaction network based on the Miller et al. (2004) network. 

P_Reaction_Set_Simlified.cti : simplified P/H/O reaction network for hydrogen rich environment. 
my_silane_v2_simplified.cti : simplied Si/H/O reaction network for hydrogen rich environment.
